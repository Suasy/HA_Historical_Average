# Historical Average Algorithm for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting 

## Introdution

This repository implements the historical averaging algorithm for the prediction of spatio-temporal data. The algorithm predicts future values based on the average of the corresponding historical data points, which can be used as the most basic baseline.
